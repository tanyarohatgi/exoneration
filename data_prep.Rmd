### READING IN DATA: ###

exon <- read_excel("publicspreadsheet.xlsx") %>%
  clean_names()

# The code manual/explainer for the dataset can be accessed here:
# http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Coding_Manual_Public.pdf
```


```{r}
### CLEANING/FORMATTING DATA: ###

exon$exonerated <- as.numeric(exon$exonerated)
exon$convicted <- as.numeric(exon$convicted)

e <- exon %>%
  select(-c(list_addl_crimes_recode, posting_date)) %>%
  mutate(served = exonerated - convicted) %>%
  mutate(
    dna = str_to_lower(dna), 
    x = str_to_lower(x), 
    fc = str_to_lower(fc), 
    mwid = str_to_lower(mwid),
    f_mfe = str_to_lower(f_mfe), 
    p_fa = str_to_lower(p_fa), 
    om = str_to_lower(om),
    ild = str_to_lower(ild)
  ) %>%
  unite("basis", dna:ild, sep = "; ", remove = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(basis = str_replace_all(basis, "NA;", "")) %>%
  mutate(basis = str_replace_all(basis, "NA", "")) %>%
  mutate(basis = str_to_upper(basis)) %>%
  mutate(tags = str_replace_all(tags, "#", " "))

# We must take the 'served' variable as approximations because we do not know
# exactly when after conviction individuals were sentenced and incarcerated.
# Usually, however, the maximum time elapsed between the two is 90 days for
# federal crimes (lower for other crimes). Therefore, by creating this variable
# using conviction date, we can illustrate a general sense of time served before
# exoneration. 

#I don't end up using the served variable in the final version of this project,
#but I'm keeping it around just in case I continue to work on the app.

### CREATING DATAFRAME TO USE IN APP: ###

by_crime <- e %>%
  mutate(crime_type = case_when(
    worst_crime_display %in% c("Accessory to Murder", "Arson", "Assault", "Attempt, Violent", "Attempted Murder", "Child Abuse", "Dependent Adult Abuse", "Kidnapping", "Manslaughter", "Murder", "Other Violent Felony", "Robbery") ~ "Violent Crimes (Non-Sexual)",
    worst_crime_display %in% c("Child Sex Abuse", "Sex Offender Registration", "Sexual Assault") ~ "Violent Crimes (Sexual)",
    worst_crime_display %in% c("Bribery", "Burglary/Unlawful Entry", "Conspiracy", "Destruction of Property", "Failure to Pay Child Support", "Filing a False Report", "Forgery", "Fraud", "Obstruction of Justice", "Other Nonviolent Felony", "Perjury", "Possession of Stolen Property", "Solicitation", "Tax Evasion/Fraud", "Theft", "Traffic Offense", "Threats") ~ "Non-Violent Crimes",
    worst_crime_display %in% c( "Harassment", "Menacing", "Official Misconduct", "Stalking", "Supporting Terrorism") ~ "Vary-by-Case Crimes"
  )) %>%
  mutate(crime_type = coalesce(crime_type, worst_crime_display))

# Here, I have attempted to categorise crime by physical harm/violence (with
# some, such as harrassment or support for terrorism that could fall into either
# category depending on the case). There are a few categories, such as
# immigration or drug crimes, that I have left uncategorised, because they are
# qualitatively distinct from other types and so merit individual analysis.
# Later in the project I spend much time analysing one of these â€” drug-related
# crimes.


### CREATING AN.RDS FILE FOR THE APP: ###

write_rds(by_crime, "by_crime.rds")
write_rds(by_crime, "exoneration_app/by_crime.rds")
```

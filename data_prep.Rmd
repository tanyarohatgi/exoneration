# We must take the 'served' variable as approximations because we do not know exactly when after conviction individuals were sentenced and incarcerated. Usually, however, the maximum time elapsed between the two is 90 days for federal crimes (lower for other crimes). Therefore, by creating this variable using conviction date, we can illustrate a general sense of time served before exoneration.

# Here, I have attempted to categorise crime by physical harm/violence (with some, such as harrassment or support for terrorism that could fall into either category depending on the case). There are a few categories, such as immigration or drug crimes, that I have left uncategorised, because they are qualitatively distinct from other types and so merit individual analysis.
